Step1: Two-IP library synthesis on the original file
Step2: Extract logic cones on this synthesized netlist (Nimisha)
Step3: Select the logic cone and convert it to benchfile using bench convert (Abhro)
Step4: Apply caslock (python -Abhro)
Step5: Using ABC convert the benchfile to verilog RTL (using test.sh script)
Step6: Convert this RTL to Synthesized netlist using post_abc_synthesis script

Approach 2:
Step7: Using VCS open schematic and check for the caslock net
Step8: Set this net to stuck-at-fault in the post abc synthesized netlist 
Step9: Run lec_check_final_combo.do 

Approach 3:
Step10: Full library synthesis on the locked file using post_abc_synthesis, repeat step 6
Step11: run approach_3.tcl
Step12: run hash.py to obtain the keyinputs mapping
